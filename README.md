# Dice Rolling Simulator

This is a Dice Rolling Simulator Game built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. A dice rolling simulator is a game that simulates the rolling of a dice, typically used for games of chance. The goal of the game is to roll the dice and get the highest score possible.

In this game, you will be prompted to enter your name, and then you will be asked to roll the dice. You will be given 5 chances to roll the dice, and your score will be calculated based on the sum of your rolls. The computer will also roll the dice, and its score will be calculated in the same way. At the end of the game, the winner will be determined by comparing your score with the computer's score.

By writing this code, you will learn several key concepts in Python programming. You will learn how to define and use classes, including how to define class variables and instance variables. You will also learn how to use methods to implement game mechanics, including how to define functions, use loops, and implement user input. Additionally, you will learn about error handling and exception handling in Python, including how to catch and handle common errors. By working through this code, you will gain a deeper understanding of Python programming, including how to use it to create functional, interactive programs.

## Task:

Your task is to handle errors from user input in `get_user_roll()` method. If the user enters an invalid input, the function should print a message indicating that the input was invalid and prompt the user to try again. The function should continue to prompt the user until a valid input is entered.
Replace the "TODO" string and replace it with your code.

## Hints:

Use a try-except block to handle the `ValueError` that is raised when the user inputs a non-integer value.
Use an `if` statement to check if the user input is between 1 and 6.
Use a `while` loop to keep prompting the user until a valid input is entered.
_Note:_
Be sure to test your code thoroughly to make sure it works as expected.

## How to Run

1. You will need Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download the `dice_rolling_simulator.py` file to your computer. You can simply clone it using

```git
git clone https://github.com/iamfaqeehhokyky/Dice-Rolling-Simulator.git
```

3. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have saved the `dice_rolling_simulator.py` file.
4. Run the following command using:

```py
python dice_rolling_simulator.py
```

The program will prompt you to enter a value between 1 and 6. If you enter a valid value, the program will simulate rolling a dice and display the result. You can continue rolling the dice as many times as you want.

## Modifying the Code

If you want to modify the code, you can do so using any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) that supports Python. The code is written in Python 3.
